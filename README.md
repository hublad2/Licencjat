# Zadania nieobliczeniowe

The site is meant to be a platform for the qualitative physics problems.

Whole project was made as website, for the following reasons:

- it is more accesible to students and easier to work with
- provides feedback, so that it can be used without the help of a teacher
- enables the usage of YT platform, which is obviously, a great teaching aid

## Videos

Thanks to YT API, only fragments of the videos can be played, so that the user only sees the important part.

## Problems

Each problem is a single .js file that contains HTML of the the problem page, which is then injected into the DOM when needed, so the whole application can stay single-page.

## Charts

The site uses [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) to display graphs.
